Security::
* Added CachingRealm to published artifacts so it can be used in custom realm
extensions.
* If the realm uses native role mappings and the security index health changes,
the realm caches are cleared. For example, they are cleared when the index
recovers from a red state, when the index is deleted, when the index becomes
outdated, and when the index becomes up-to-date.
* Fixed a bug that could prevent auditing to a remote index if the remote
cluster was re-started at the same time as the audited cluster.
* Removed AuthorityKeyIdentifier's Issuer and Serial number from certificates
generated by `certgen` and `certutil`. This improves compatibility with
certificate verification in {kib}.

Watcher::
* Proxies now use HTTP by default, which was the default prior to 6.0. This
fixes issues with HTTPS requests that tried to access proxies via HTTP.
* Fixed the HTML sanitizer settings
(`xpack.notification.email.html.sanitization.*`), which were broken in 6.2. For
more information, see <<notification-settings>>.

Machine Learning::
* Increased tokenization flexibility for categorization. Now all {es} analyzer
functionality is available, which opens up the possibility of sensibly
categorizing non-English log messages. For more information, see {stack-ov}/ml-configuring-categories.html#ml-configuring-analyzer[Customizing the Categorization Analyzer].
* Improved the sensitivity of the analysis to high variance data with lots of
values near zero.
* Improved the decay rate of the model memory by using a weighted moving average.
* Machine learning indices created after upgrading to 6.2 have the
`auto_expand_replicas: 0-1` setting rather than a fixed setting of 1 replica.
As a result, {ml} indices created after upgrading to 6.2 can have a green
status on single node clusters. There is no impact in multi-node clusters.
* Changed the credentials that are used by {dfeeds}. When {security} is enabled,
a {dfeed} stores the roles of the user who created or updated the {dfeed}
**at that time**. This means that if those roles are updated, the {dfeed}
subsequently runs with the new permissions that are associated with the roles.
However, if the user's roles are adjusted after creating or updating the {dfeed}
then the {dfeed} continues to run with the permissions that are associated with
the original roles. For more information, see
{stack-ov}/ml-dfeeds.html[Datafeeds].
* Added a new `scheduled` forecast status, which indicates that the forecast
has not started yet.

Mapping::
* Allow `_doc` as a type. {pull}27816[#27816] (issues: {issue}27750[#27750], {issue}27751[#27751])

Monitoring::
* {monitoring} indices (`.monitoring`) created after upgrading to 6.2 have the
`auto_expand_replicas: 0-1` setting rather than a fixed setting of 1 replica.
As a result, monitoring indices created after upgrading to 6.2 can have a green
status on single node clusters. There is no impact in multi-node clusters.
* Added a cluster alert that triggers whenever a node is added, removed, or
restarted.

Network::
* Add NioGroup for use in different transports {pull}27737[#27737] (issue: {issue}27260[#27260])

action. For more information, see {stack-ov}/actions-index.html[Index Action].

refresh policy of the write request. For more information, see
{stack-ov}/actions-index.html[Index Action].
* Added support for actions in slack attachments, which enables you to add
buttons that can be clicked in slack messages. For more information, see
{stack-ov}/actions-slack.html[Slack Action].
* {watcher} indices (`.watch*` and `triggered_watches`) created after upgrading
to 6.2 have the `auto_expand_replicas: 0-1` setting rather than a fixed setting
of 1 replica. As a result, {watcher} indices created after upgrading to 6.2 can
have a green status on single node clusters. There is no impact in multi-node
clusters.

Snapshot/Restore::
* Use AmazonS3.doesObjectExist() method in S3BlobContainer {pull}27723[#27723]

Watcher::
* Ensured the watcher thread pool size is reasonably bound. In particular, the
watcher thread pool size is now five times the number of processors until 50
threads are reached. If more than 50 cores exist and 50 threads exist, the
watch thread pool size grows to match the number of processors.

* Improve shard-failed log messages. {pull}26866[#26866]

Machine Learning::
* Improved the way {ml} jobs are allocated to nodes, such that it is primarily
determined by the estimated memory requirement of the job. If there is insufficient
information about the job's memory requirements, the allocation decision is based
on job counts per node.
* Increased the default value of the `xpack.ml.max_open_jobs` setting from `10`
to `20`. The allocation of jobs to nodes now considers memory usage as well as
job counts, so it's reasonable to permit more small jobs on a single node. For
more information, see <<ml-settings>>.
* Decreased the default `model_memory_limit` property value to 1 GB for new jobs.
If you want to create a job that analyzes high cardinality fields, you can
increase this property value. For more information, see <<ml-apilimits>>.
* Improved analytics related to decay rates when predictions are very accurate.
* Improved analytics related to detecting non-negative quantities and using this
information to constrain analysis, predictions, and confidence intervals.
* Improved periodic trough or spike detection.
* Improved the speed of the aggregation of {ml} results.
* Improved probability calculation performance.
* Expedited bucket processing time in very large populations by determining when
there are nearly duplicate values in a bucket and de-duplicating the samples that
are added to the model.
* Improved handling of periodically missing values.
* Improved analytics related to diurnal periodicity.
* Reduced memory usage during population analysis by releasing redundant memory
after the bucket results are written.
* Improved modeling of long periodic components, particularly when there is a
long bucket span.

Mapping::
