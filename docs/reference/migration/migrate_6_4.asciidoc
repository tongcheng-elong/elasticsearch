=== API changes

==== Field capabilities request format

In the past, `fields` could be provided either as a parameter, or as part of the request
body. Specifying `fields` in the request body is now deprecated, and instead they should
always be supplied through a request parameter. In 7.0.0, the field capabilities API will
not accept `fields` supplied in the request body.

[[copy-source-settings-on-resize]]
==== Copying source settings during shrink/split operations

In prior versions of Elasticsearch, resize operations (shrink/split) would only
copy `index.analysis`, `index.similarity`, and `index.sort` settings from the
source index. Elasticsearch 6.4.0 introduces a request parameter `copy_settings`
which will copy all index settings from the source except for non-copyable index
settings. This parameter defaults to `false` in 6.x, is immediately deprecated
in 6.4.0, will only be able to be set to `true` in 8.x, and will be removed in
9.0.0. Note than when this parameter is used it means that all copyable settings
will be copied; this includes the index blocks that must be put in place for a
resize operation, and any allocation settings put in place in preparation for
executing the resize operation. If you use this parameter, you will either have
to follow up the operation with a request to adjust to the desired settings on
the target index, or send the desired value of these settings with the resize
operation.
