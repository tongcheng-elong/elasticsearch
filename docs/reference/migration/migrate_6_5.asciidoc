=== Logging changes

==== %node_name in logging pattern

To make the node name appear consistently in Elasticsearch's logs and to clean
up much of the internal logging code we've removed the node name from the
"marker" in the logging configuration. If you do not customize your logging
configuration file then there is nothing for you to do. If you *do* customize
your logging configuration properties then you should replace `%marker` with
`[%node_name]%marker `, including the trailing space. If you do not do so
Elasticsearch will log a warning on startup and log with the new pattern. It
will not change the logging configuration files though. You should make this
change before 7.0 because in 7.0 Elasticsearch will no longer automatically
add the node name to the logging configuration if it isn't already present.
