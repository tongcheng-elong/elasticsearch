== Cross Cluster Search, Tribe, Clients and Integrations

When using {ref}/modules-cross-cluster-search.html[Cross Cluster Search] or
{ref}/modules-tribe.html[Tribe Nodes] you need to take extra steps to secure
communications with the connected clusters.

* <<cross-cluster-configuring, Cross Cluster Search and Security>>
* <<tribe-node-configuring, Tribe Nodes and Security>>

You will need to update the configuration for several clients to work with a
secured cluster:

* <<java-clients, Java Clients>>
* <<http-clients, HTTP Clients>>


{security} enables you to secure your {es} cluster. But {es} itself is only one
product within the Elastic Stack. It is often the case that other products in
the stack are connected to the cluster and therefore need to be secured as well,
or at least communicate with the cluster in a secured way:

* <<hadoop, Apache Hadoop>>
