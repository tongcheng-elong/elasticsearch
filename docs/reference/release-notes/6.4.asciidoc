=== New Features

The new <<mapping-ignored-field,`_ignored`>> field allows to know which fields
got ignored at index time because of the <<ignore-malformed,`ignore_malformed`>>
option. ({pull}30140[#29658])

A new analysis plugin called `analysis_nori` that exposes the Lucene Korean
analysis module.  ({pull}30397[#30397])

Rollup::
* A new API allows getting the rollup capabilities of specific rollup indices,
rather than by the target pattern ({pull}30401[#30401])

[float]
=== Enhancements

{ref-64}/breaking_64_api_changes.html#copy-source-settings-on-resize[Allow copying source settings on index resize operations] ({pull}30255[#30255])

Geo::
* Add validation that geohashes are not empty and don't contain unsupported characters ({pull}30376[#30376])

Rollup::
* Validate timezone in range queries to ensure they match the selected job when
searching ({pull}30338[#30338])
* Rollup now indexes `null` values, meaning a single "unified" job for heterogeneous data is now the recommended pattern ({pull}31402[#31402])
* Rollup Search endpoint now supports the `terms` query  ({pull}30973[#30973])
* Rollups no longer allow patterns that match it's `rollup_index`, which can lead to strange errors ({pull}30491[#30491])
* Validation errors thrown while creating a rollup job are now a specialization of the previous `ActionRequestValidationException`,
 making it easier to catch.  The new exception is `RollupActionRequestValidationException` ({pull}30339[#30339])

[float]
=== Bug Fixes

Use date format in `date_range` mapping before fallback to default ({pull}29310[#29310])

Fix NPE in 'more_like_this' when field has zero tokens ({pull}30365[#30365])

Do not ignore request analysis/similarity settings on index resize operations when the source index already contains such settings ({pull}30216[#30216])

Fix NPE when CumulativeSum agg encounters null value/empty bucket ({pull}29641[#29641])

Rollup::
* Move to 128bit document IDs for Rollup.  The old IDs were not wide enough and susceptible to hashing collisions.
Jobs that are running during cluster upgrade will "self-upgrade" to the new ID scheme, but it is recommended that users
fully rebuild Rollup indices from scratch if possible.  Any existing collisions are not fixable and so data-loss may
affect the rollup index despite the new IDs being used. ({pull}32558[#32558])
* Histo group configurations should support `scaled_float` ({pull}32048[#32048])
* Fix rollup on date fields that don't support `epoch_millis` ({pull}31890[#31890])
* Metric config properly validates itself now ({pull}31159[#31159])
